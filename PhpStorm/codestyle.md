# Code styles in PhpStorm

The [`codestyles`](codestyles) directory contains xml-files that can be put in your PhpStorm config directory `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde90/codestyles`.
Codestyles can then be selected in PhpStorm settings: __Editor__ > __Code Style__ under *Scheme*.

* [The FEW code style](/FEW code style.md): [FEW.xml](codestyles/FEW.xml)
