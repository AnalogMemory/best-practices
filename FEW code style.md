# FEW code style
Our code style guide is work in progress.

For PHP we use [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)/[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) which use 4 spaces for indenting.

For all other files we generally use 2 spaces for indenting to save space and keep the right margin free a little longer. This applies to HTML, XML, CSS, LESS, SASS, JavaScript, JSON, Blade etc.
