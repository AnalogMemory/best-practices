# FEW code style
Our code style guide is work in progress.

## PHP
For PHP we use [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)/[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) which use 4 spaces for indenting.

## Other file types
For all other files we generally use 2 spaces for indenting to save space and keep the right margin free a little longer.
This applies to HTML, XML, CSS, LESS, SASS, JavaScript, JSON, Blade, etc.

## For editors
This repo contains an [`.editorconfig` file](/.editorconfig) that can be copied into project root directories
to help editors keep the style consistent.
We also have a slightly more extensive [PhpStorm config](/PhpStorm/codestyle.md).
